Industry: Cement,Cement emissions intensity,CO2 emissions per unit cement produced,kg CO2 / t product,"The main source of this analysis was the Global Cement Database (WBCSD, 2017). This database provides intensities for different types of cement and related products. We used data on ""Weighted average net CO2 emission per tonne cementitious"". These data do not include emissions from electricity consumption, but the same database provides data on electricity consumption per tonne cement. To calculate scope 2 emissions, the electricity consumption per tonne of cement is combined with national average CO2 emission factors of electricity generation from IEA (IEA, 2018).The WBCSD data do not cover all cement installations in a country and data on countries with a low coverage have larger uncertainties. For example in India, 45% of the production is covered, in the USA and Brazil more than 70% and in the EU and Canada more than 90%. We have excluded the data for China, because only a few percent of the cement production is covered in the database. Cement production data were taken from the USGS (USGS, 2012; USGS, 2016; USGS, 2017; USGS, 2019).
