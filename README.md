Tool to monitor G20 members environmental indicators as they account for 85 per cent of the world economy, 
75 per cent of global trade, and two-thirds of the world's population, including more than half of the world's poor.

This tool using, HTML, JavaScript, python, webscrapping, mapping and visualization tools allow us to create a
web-based app with a SQL data base from various sources of information.

I have built seven pages to show 1970-2016 historic data and 2017-2022 forecast country CO2 Emmissions, historic world bank data,
webscrapping of World Bank site for latest environmental news and to show all current commitments for the The Paris Agreement 
(French: Le Accord de Paris) and two pages with Global Temperature Facts and current You Tube educational videos.
